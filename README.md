# osu-lua-modding-tool
OsuExec is a tool coded in C# to allow modding of the osu! client using Lua. 

## Notices
Using OsuExec to create cheats may result in an account restriction.

Be careful running scripts from other people, since scripts have a lot of power over the osu! process.

## Features
### Custom Lua Environment
Our custom Lua environment allows for use of custom functions and values for modding purposes.

### UI/Memory functions
OsuExec also allows you to create user interfaces and modify the game's memory, allowing for even more mods to be made.

### Infinite Possibilities 
This tool allows for almost anything you can think of to be created, ranging from aim assist scripts to pp counters.
